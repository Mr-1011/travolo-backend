# Travolo Backend

A sophisticated travel recommendation engine that uses AI-powered image analysis, hybrid filtering algorithms, and user feedback to provide personalized destination recommendations.

## üåü Features

### Core Recommendation Engine
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for optimal recommendations
- **AI Image Analysis**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision to analyze travel photos and infer user preferences
- **Dynamic Learning**: Adapts recommendations based on user feedback (likes/dislikes)
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Considers themes, climate, budget, duration, regions, and distance

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Climate Matching**: Matches destinations to user's preferred temperature ranges and travel months
- **Budget & Duration Filtering**: Filters based on travel budget levels and trip duration preferences
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Calculates distances and applies duration-based penalties for far destinations
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence percentages (0-100%) for each recommendation

### User Experience
- **Photo-based Preferences**: Upload up to 3 travel photos to automatically adjust preference scores
- **Feedback Learning**: System learns from destination ratings to improve future recommendations
- **Personalized Profiles**: Supports complex user preference profiles with 9 travel themes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture


1. **Recommendation Algorithm** (`recommendationAlgorithm.js`)
   - Main orchestrator for generating recommendations
   - Processes user feedback and adjusts preferences
   - Combines content and collaborative scores

2. **Content-Based Filtering** (`contentFiltering.js`)
   - Calculates similarity between user preferences and destinations
   - Handles theme matching, climate scoring, budget/region/duration filtering
   - Uses cosine similarity and Gaussian climate scoring

3. **Collaborative Filtering** (`collaborativeFiltering.js`)
   - Analyzes user behavior patterns
   - Maintains item similarity matrix
   - Provides recommendations based on similar users' preferences

4. **Image Analysis Service** (`services/imageService.js`)
   - Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
   - Analyzes travel photos to extract preference insights
   - Updates user preference scores based on visual cues

5. **Recommendation Service** (`services/recommendationService.js`)
   - Coordinates the recommendation generation process
   - Manages database operations
   - Handles similarity matrix refresh

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## üß† Algorithm Details

### Recommendation Process

1. **Feedback Analysis**: Analyzes user's previous destination ratings to identify preference patterns
2. **Preference Adjustment**: Modifies base preferences based on liked/disliked destination features
3. **Content Scoring**: Calculates similarity between adjusted preferences and destination attributes
4. **Collaborative Scoring**: Finds similar users and recommends destinations they liked
5. **Hybrid Combination**: Merges content (70%) and collaborative (30%) scores when user feedback exists
6. **Ranking & Confidence**: Sorts by hybrid score and maps to confidence percentages

### Image Analysis Process

1. **Image Upload**: Receives up to 3 travel photos via multipart upload
2. **AI Analysis**: Sends images to OpenAI GPT-4 Vision with structured prompts
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies visual cues (mountains‚Üíadventure, beaches‚Üínature, etc.)
4. **Delta Calculation**: Computes adjustment values (-3 to +3) for each theme
5. **Preference Update**: Applies adjustments to user's base preference scores

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Errors**: Ensure API key is valid and has sufficient credits
2. **Supabase Connection**: Verify URL and keys are correct in `.env`
3. **Image Upload Fails**: Check file size limits (10MB) and supported formats
4. **Empty Recommendations**: Ensure destination database is populated

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your environment.
